{"name":"Squadbox","tagline":"A lean modal box","body":"# SquadBox\r\n\r\nA lean modal box\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Basic\r\n\r\nYou should assign an element to the modal. Usually, you'll attach it to the element firing the modal.\r\n\r\nThen, call the ```'show'``` method for the modal. Below is an overview on how to show the modal.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar $el = $('<div />')\r\nvar options = {\r\n    class: 'my-class',\r\n    content: '<div class=\"modal\">Put your stuff here!</div>',\r\n    id: 'my-id'\r\n}\r\n\r\n$el.squadbox(options)\r\n$el.click(function () {\r\n    $el.squadbox('show')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! Customize it the way you like with CSS and you're done. Here's the full list of options:\r\n- ```target```: the selector for the container of the modal. Defaults to ```'body'```\r\n- ```id```: a custom id attribute for the modal, so you can layout easier. Defaults to ```'squadbox'```\r\n- ```class```: a custom class for the modal, so you can layout easier. Defaults to ```'squadbox'```\r\n- ```content```: the content to show. This is a required attribute.\r\n- ```showCss```: an object with the custom CSS to set when calling the 'show' method. Defaults to ```{opacity: 1}```\r\n- ```hideCss```: an object with the custom CSS to set when calling the 'hide' method. Defaults to ```{opacity: 1}```\r\n\r\n### Callbacks\r\n\r\nIf you want to add specific behaviors on some steps of the modal lifecycle, you can attach functions to some events. Like this:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nfunction alertCallback()\r\n{\r\n    alert(this.attr('id'))\r\n}\r\n\r\n$el.squadbox(options)\r\n$el.squadbox('show', alertCallback)\r\n\r\n$el.click(function () {\r\n    $el.squadbox('show')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will pop an alert every time you ```show``` the modal. Here's the full list of handles:\r\n- ```create```: the moment the modal is created\r\n- ```show```: every moment the modal is shown\r\n- ```hide```: every moment the modal is hidden\r\n","google":"UA-40405410-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
